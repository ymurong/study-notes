# Agile methodologies
Agile methodologies aim to deliver the right product, with incremental and frequent delivery of small chunks of functionality, through small cross-functional self-organizing teams, enabling frequent customer feedback and course correction as needed.

# Events in Scrum
Each of the Scrum events facilitates the adaptation of some of the aspects of the process, the product, progress or relationships.

- Sprint: Sprint is the basic unit of work for a Scrum team. This is the main feature that marks the difference between Scrum and other models for agile development.

- Sprint Planning: The goal of the Sprint Planning is to define what is going to be done in the Sprint and how it is going to be done. This meeting is held at the beginning of each Sprint and is defined how it will approach the project coming from the Product Backlog stages and deadlines. Each Sprint is composed of different features.

- Daily Scrum: The objective of the Daily Scrum is to evaluate the progress and trend until the end of the Sprint, synchronizing the activities and creating a plan for the next 24 hours. It is a brief meeting that takes place daily during the Sprint period. Three questions are answered individually:  What did I do yesterday? What am I going to do today? What help do I need?  The Scrum Master should try to solve problems or obstacles that arise.

- Sprint Review: The goal of the sprint review is to show what work has been completed with regards to the product backlog for future deliveries. The finished sprint is reviewed, and there should already be a clear and tangible advancement in the product to present to the client.

- Sprint Retrospective: The team reviews the completed goals of the finished sprint, write down the good and the bad, so as not to repeat the mistakes again. This stage serves to implement improvements from the point of view of the development process. The goal of the sprint retrospective is to identify possible process improvements and generate a plan to implement them in the next Sprint.


# Backlog Refinement (Definition of Ready)

In Scrum, Backlog Refinement is an ongoing process in which the Product Owner and the Development Team collaborate to ensure that items on the Product Backlog:
- are understood the same way by all involved (shared understanding),
- have a size estimate for the (relative) complexity and effort of their implementation, and
- are ordered according to their priority in terms of business value and effort required.
