# How we can accelerate business innovations with AI & Data
1. generate insights
2. create operational efficiencies
3. add innovations to existing products
4. develop new products


## Insights generation
### User data
### Revenue data
### Product data

### Example: IBM predictive the churn rate of employees -> save 300M of employee retention costs


## Operational efficiencies
Modelling that helps business 
- manage inventory 
- make hiring decisions
- customer service requests

### Example:
Chatbots: save up to $0.7 cents per customer interaction
Walmart: Tests AI on stock control


## Add innovations to existing products
salesforce CRM: einstein -> get deeper insights about their customer base
    - differentiation from competitors
    - attract customer acquisition

decatholon: chatgpt in point of sale

## Developing a new product
Amazon Alexa




# when to use AI
AI wont be the best solution to all problems

Situation
Task: A question 
Action: user interviews, review relevant customer support requests, gather ideas from various departments
Result: AI not the best way

- when human expert could perform a task in a few seconds
- when it is difficult or impossible to write down the rules
- when it is easy to get labeled data
- the right resources: hardware: DA: sort/clean data, DS: build the model DE: serve the model


# SWOT Analysis (identify opportunities for applying AI & Data)
competitive and market analysis
1. availabilities of a large and organized data set
2. what data do you have the most of
3. what data do you have a lack of 
4. employee skills
5. customer base
6. product features


- Strength
- Weakness
- Opportunities
- Threats

# Building a hypothesis
Specific hypothesis (AB test, causal inference)
1. target group
2. assumption
3. goal
4. the expected impact 
5. how measure success

We believe our new users have a problem finding other users they want to follow (assumption). If we develop a machine learning recommendation system, we will increase the number of people that our users follow (goal), by 20% in their first month of using the product (measurement).

# Testing hypothesis

1. why we have this problem???  -> find what to test -> know whether AI is proper solution

Linkedin (people don't like comment)
- people don't see the value -> communicating the value
- people don't want to comment on unknown people -> look at the data for how many users prefer to like rather than comment on people they don't know
- UX: like is simpler than comment


# AI BUSINESS CANVAS

1. Prediction
2. Judgement (FP, FN impact)
3. Action (what action a user can make when prediction is made)
4. Outcome (performance measures)

1. Training (Training set)
2. Input (Test set)
3. Feedback (how you can use the model's outcome to improve the model in the next generation, reuse to train the model)
