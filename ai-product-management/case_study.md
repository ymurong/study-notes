# Diagnose Problems
Metric shifted -> figure out root cause

1. clarify scenario/metric
2. time, sudden/stable
3. other product/feature by the same company
4. segment by user demographic and behavior features
5. decompose the metric
6. summarize overall approach



# measure success
1. clarify the goal of product/feature
   - what it does, how is it used, who is it for
2. define metrics (no more than 3)
    - 2 Success rates (DAU, Conversion rate)
    - 1 Guardrail metric: should not degrade in pursuit of a new product/feature, cancelation rate and bounce rate


# Launch or not 
1. clarify goal and define metrics
   - what it does, how is it used, who is it for
2. experimentation
   - how to design
   - how to split the users
   - how long to run it
3. Recommendation based on experimentation results
   - link results to goal, user impact and business impact
   - conflicting results -> short-term, long-term
