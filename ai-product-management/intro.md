# Course Structure

## How to Strategize (1-5)

## How to Develop

## How to Manage

# Cross Functional Domains
1. AI
2. Business
3. UX
4. DATA

Leveraging existing data, prioritize the products that are technically feasible but also bring value to business and customers

# Why product manager important in AI
13% DS projects make it to production.

PM make sure that they build the right thing at the right time in the right way.
DS team should work as a product team.


# Reasons a Data Project fails
1. data science is all about experimentation -> not all experiments succeed
2. not leading the projects with a product mindset

# Why Data product manager can be hard
1. what it takes to develop a product (hard skills with software engineering and data engineering)
2. fully understand your data (statistical / data science background)
3. how to work with uncertain timelines and outputs -> adaptability + reliable + strategic (know how to manage risks and uncertainties + strong project management experience)

AI product manager is more challenging as unpredictable results comparing to normal software 

# The role of PM
1. act as the CEO of the product + entrepreneur spirit
2. a person is a multidisciplinary individual who identifies
   1. what product to build
   2. when to build it 
   3. why it needs to be built
3. define what's most needed 
   1. listening + researching 
   2. which one good ideas, bad ideas 
   3. which one is feasible given our tech abilities
   4. which one we should do now and which one we focus later on
   5. multi-sources: users, other people, data, industry trends
   6. exploring, prioritizing, and actioning on ideas
4. intersection of UX, TECH, BUSINESS, needs to compromise and collaborate (too costly to collect, user privacy?)

# The role of PM in AI/Data
Intersection of UX, TECH, BUSINESS, DATA

- Data: collection, security, variety, accuracy of the data being used in algo
- Work on projects that help collect more data from the users
- Work with third parties to acquire annotated data
- Work with analysts to clean and prepare the data for use

Ensure the team have the right data / enough data to build the models that they were working on

## added challenges
1. more uncertainties
   - uncertain timelines 
   - uncertain investments
   - uncertain end performance
2. more difficult in communicating to stakeholders
   1. educating/coaching business people about how AI really works



# My vision of PM in data/AI
1. PM responsibilties (what, when, why) through active listening + research (quantitative + qualitative)
2. Intersection of UX,TECH,BUSINESS,DATA: compromise (benefits vs complexity), collaborate with cross functional teams, communication with stakeholders
3. manage more uncertainties and expectations
