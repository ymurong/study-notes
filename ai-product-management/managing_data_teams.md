# AI Hierarchy of needs
- data collection (you need data!)
- data infrastructure (pipelines, ETL, data storage)
- data analytics (customer/product insights, clean/prepare data, ab testing)
- data science (ability to craft more advanced models)
- AI

AI & data product investments are risky
- different time frame (5 month, 1 year, 5 year)
- start with small projects to show early wins (high/low benefit, high/low complexity)
  - high benefit, low complexity (must do) -> regression + decision trees
  - low benefit, low complexity (can do)
  - low benefit, high complexity (do case by case)
  - high benefit, high complexity (need to do)
- evaluate position in the hierarchy of AI needs, risk aversion of your organization -> decides the work prioritization


# AI within an Org
AI is a fairly new specialization
AI products have a different life cycles than traditional software products
A good infrastructure that is built for all BUs
AI PM needs to collaborate with other BUs
    - understand the workflows of the another team
    - connect AI dev to theirs
    - Align the goals between the two teams


# Roles 
1 AI/Data product managers
- accountable for what to build, when to build and why to build
- facilitates discussions
- Manage ideas
- unite the team members

2 Data Scientists
- more research oriented

1 ML Data Engineers
- ingestion, data infra, data warehousing, data pipelines


1 FULL STACK SDE
1 Outsource UX


# Team Workflow
1. problem identification (PM, UX)
   1. brain storm
   2. user research 
   3. market research
   4. identify solutions
   5. select metrics of performance
2. data sourcing (DE, DS)
   1. locate and extract and make available
3. data preparation (DE,DS)
4. model building (DS)
5. deployment (DE,SDE)
6. monitoring (DE,DS)

# Dual-Triple Track Agile
Reduce Waiting gaps, allow all team members to work simulatenously
- Discovery Track (PM)
  - validating a series of product ideas to put in the backlog
- Data Track (DE)
  - Datasets associated with these validated ideas are being sourced and prepared
- DEV & Delivery (DS)
  - The sourced data sets are used to begin exploring and modelling
