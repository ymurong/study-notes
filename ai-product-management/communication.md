# Internal stakeholder management
3I  (interest in the product, influence the product decisions, is impacted directly or indirectly by the product)

Listen to your stakeholder's ideas, responsibilities and feedback (prevent the product from being launched)
-> ensure the launch

# 5 steps for successful stakeholder management

1. Build a relationship
    - build an informal relationship
2. Listen to their perspective
    - their roles
    - helpful knowledge, not take their ideas
3. educate them on AI & Data
   - why a model is not 100% accurate
4. keep them informed 
   - about the progress of the product dev
5. set boundaries
   - a product manager is accountable to the user, not the stakeholders


# set data expectations
- common failure for ai projects
- ai is not magic (they are science) -> not all problems solves by AI
- ai take time (built through trials and errors) -> long-term investments
- aligning expectations to reality

actions:
- educate your org on how AI & data modelling works
- provide frequent updates of each stage of product dev
  - ideation
  - prototype
  - dev (not make it to launch)
  - launch

still share the finding even if failure


# active listening & communication
team, users, stakeholders

- pay close attention (eye contact, face directly, body lang)
- show that you are listening
- confirm what you heard
  - it sounds like 
  - what I am hearing is ...
  - I've noticed that
- ask clarifying questions


# storytelling
- share data points around the performance
- tell a story around these number
- ensure the message simple
- visuals, personal anecdotes and user quotes
- being an advocate for the work done by the team
  

1. Hero(user), Goal(user want), Villain(user problem)
2. sidekick(product), plot(how the product helps)
3. numbers (impact) -> metrics, users and proof that this product will or has helped users
4. action (what one conclusion that you want people to do with this information)
