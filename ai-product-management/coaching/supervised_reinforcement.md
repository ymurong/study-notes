- anormaly detection

## unsupervised
without labels
- clustering 
- anormaly detection

## reinforcement 
about optimize a reward (dynamic programming -> where you know the reward beforehand)
reinforcement learning do not know the reward beforehand and needs to do trials and errors to figure out the best approach with the best reward
