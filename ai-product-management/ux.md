# Getting to the core problem
3 why methods to understand the root cause and find the countermeasures
- don't user's solutions, adopt user's problem

# User research methods
1. Market research & User Data -> quantitative
2. Exploratory Interviews + Observations (who are they, what they like, what they feel excited) -> qualitative
    - know the painpoints of users, not about presenting solutions
    - keep the questions open ended
    - to see whether they bring up their problems on their own
3. Draft surveys (be careful of bias)

# User personas
## The empathy map
write out the core problem 
- user: tom who ....
- says: quotes what they say or might say
- thinks: user might think
- does: actions that user might do 
- feels: what they feel facing the problem

## Prototype with AI
- Wireframe
- AI personality design (robotics, speech assistants, chatbots)
- WOZ Experiments (AI system operated by human) to test the idea
