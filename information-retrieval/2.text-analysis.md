# Content of Table
## Statistical properties of text
### Zipf’s law
- Word Frequency **Probability**(P_r) is inversely proportional to **Ranking**.
- $Rank * P_r$ = Const' (stable to a value)
- English's const' $\approx$ 0.1
- Top frequency words would slightly deviate from the law
- Low frequency words would slightly deviate from the law
  

###  Heap’s law
- \# unique words is sub-linear to \# words in a collection
- the more words -> not that much more unique words
- vocab = k * $words^\beta$ (10<=k<=100, $\beta \approx 0.5$)

## Text Analysis pipeline

### Pipeline
- Remove white-spaces and punctuation
- Lower-case
- Remove stop-words
- Stemming
- Deal with phrases
- Apply language-specific precessing rules

### Stop-word removal
- Frequency-based
    - Set a frequency threshold f 
    - Remove words with the frequency higher than f
- Dictionary-based
  - create a dictionary of stop-words
  - remove words that occur in this dictionary 

### Stemming
#### Different types
- Algorithmic stemming: using small program to decide, based on knowledge of word suffixes for a particular language -> Porter stemmer (lengthy rule based, FP, FN)
- Dictionary-based stemming: run -> running, runs, runned. runly (New-words problem)
- Hybrid stemming (Krovetz stemmer) -> lower FP than Porter but also tends to have higher FN -> tend to have more full words
- More complicated -> Low FN, but high FP

#### Krovetz stemmer Approach 
1. Before stemming, check to see whether word is valid
2. if found, leave it as is/ or stemmed based on exception entry
3. if not found, apply algorithmic stemming (remov额suffixes)
4. check the dictionary again
5. if not found apply rules to modify the ending

#### Evaluation
- FP: organization/organ -> same stem but change meaning 
- FN: european/europe -> same meaning but stem changed
