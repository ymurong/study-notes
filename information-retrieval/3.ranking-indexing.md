# Table of Content
## Abstract Model of Ranking
### Document Score
  - calculated by sum of multiplications of document feature functions and query feature functions output 
  - $R(Q,D) = \sum_{i}g_i(Q)f_{i}(D)$
  - in practice, the query features are mostly zero (time complexity)

### Feature Function
  - a mathematical expression that generates numbers from document text (TFIDF???)
  - includes document features and query features
  - features could be **topical/quality**


#### Topical Feature
Estimate the degree to which the document/query is about a particular subject 
  - how do we decide these topical features ??? (phrases??? N-grams????)

#### Quality Feature
  - examples such as links to these documents, number of days since it was last updated
  - for query, it would be whether these qualities is relevant to given query nature (query about weather requires that the document be up-to-date)

## Data Structures for Web Page


### Inverted Index
Word -> Documents 
  - Dictionary using B+ tree, hash table
  - each entry (inverted list) contains 
    - Number of pages containing the term
    - Pointer to the start of the inverted 
    - other meta-data about the term
  - Typical Entry
    - Document Id
    - Frequencies
    - Positions
    - Weights
#### What should not be in the inverted list 
  - something is not describing the pair of word and document, such as: the number of documents containing the term (should go to vocabulary)
  - document length (page attribute file)


### Web Graph
  - HTML Pages -> HTML Parsers -> Web graph -> Content and Link analysis (link quality, link spam, duplicate detection, mirror site detection) -> web repository

### Forward Index
anchor text (web graph) + html page () -> text processor (tokenizer, phrase extractor, entity extractor) -> forward index
  - forward index: document -> words

### Page Attribute File
- Information about the documents
- forward index (page content) + web graph (attrib) -> classifiers and feature extractors (spam classifier, adult classifier, text quality estimator ...) -> page attribute file


## Constructing Index

### Simple Index
Loop for each document D -> get all unique tokens from D -> append document Index to HashTable
  - In memory problem
    - Two-pass index
    - One-pass index with merging
  - Single-threaded problem
    - distributed index

### Two-Pass Index
  1. collect term statistics
  2. create a template of the index (word -> reserved space based on statistics) on the disk (slow?????)
  3. fill in the index template 

### One-pass index with merging  (Fig 5.9)
  1.  build index A until it is full on RAM, flash it
  2.  build index B until it is full on RAM, flash it and merge with index (merge is done on disk？？？) 
####  Pitfalls
Index A should be sorted (alpha order) and stored so that afterwards the merging could be really easy with Index B 
   

### Distributed Indexing (Map-Reduce)

  -  Map: each mapper transform input (a list of documents) to a bunch of key-value pairs (postings)
  -  Shuffling: all postings of same key(word) would be together
  -  Reduce: each reducer takes care of certain keys (sorted so that no overlapping results) and aggregate them together to generate a partial index
  -  Merge together all partial index 
  -  All mapper and reducer can be parallelized(multi-threading) 


### Update an Index
keep track of new documents

#### No Merge (result merging)
  - first keep the delta index in memory until it gets full
  - flash delta index to local disk (will have multiple index along the way)
  - at query time merge all results from all index (multiple delta index + old main index)
  - low index maintainance cost
  - high query processing cost (merge at query time)

#### Incremental Update
  - only one old main index (delta index merge into old main index)
  - keep free buffer space (saved for future updates)
  - problem -> run out of free buffer space
  - **NO!!!** read/write of entire index when updating (use this to prevent from concurrent access ????)
  - concurrent access of index (read/write)


#### Immediate merge (in-memory)
  - Always a single index (delta index + old main index -> new main index)
  - needs to read/write of an entire index into disk when updating (time consuming)

#### Lazy merge
  -  difference between the lazy merge and no merge is that the delta indexes would be merged into 2nd generation index from time to time (less delta index)
  -  tradeoff between index maintenance cost and query processing

#### Page (documents) deletions 

- maintain identifiers of deleted documents in memory, and remove them from results during query processing
- garbage collection (rebuild the index -> remove the unwanted ones during index merging)
