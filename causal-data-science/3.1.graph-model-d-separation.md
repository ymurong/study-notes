## D-Separation
### Definition
D-separation is a graphical criterion that (under
standard conditions) allows us to read conditional independences:

- Are X and Y conditionally independent

### How it works
1. check all the (undirected) paths from X to Y
2. if **NO ACTIVE PATH**, then X and Y GUARANTEED conditional independence (**ONLY ONE active path would mean NOT GUARANTEE conditional independent**)
3. A path is active if **EVERY** triple is active (only one inactive triple would make whole path inactive)

### About Triples
> node is observed -> node $\in$ A, A refers to the conditions 


#### Causal Chain
- Form: A -> B -> C
- Active if middle node is unobserved (conditional dependent)
- Inactive (blocked) if middle node is observed (conditional independent)

#### Common Cause
- Form: A <- B -> C
- Active if middle node is unobserved (conditional dependent)
- Inactive if middle node is observed (conditional independent)

#### Common Effect
- Form: A -> B <- C
- Active if middle node is observed (conditional dependent)
- Inactive if middle node is unobserved (conditional independent)
- 跟之前正好相反 (collider)


### Tricks
- finding one active path -> stop -> NOT GUARANTEE CI (conditional independence)
- finding one inactive path does not mean we are done !
- finding one inactive triple -> stop -> inactive path
- when all path are inactive -> guarantee CI
- !!! Remember blocked paths can be unblocked by descendants of colliders, even when these descendants are not part of the considered path
- non-collider node -> should be in A to block
- collider node -> should not be in A to block

### D-separation conditions
A path between i and j is blocked by  if at least one 
condition holds: 
- There is a non-collider on the path that is in A, or
- There is a collider k on the path, but k $\notin$ A and Desc(k) $\cap$ A = $\empty$
