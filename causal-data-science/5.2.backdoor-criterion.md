# Content of Table
## Backdoor criterion 
### Intuition 
- Directed path from i to j are causal (both directly and indirectly) -> DO NOT BLOCK CAUSAL PATH
- Backdoor paths (all paths that start with an arrow into i <-- ...j) induce spurious associations (confoundering effects) -> SHOULD BLOCK Backdoor path
- if we block the spurious assocations, we only get the causal effect
- DO NOT INCLUDE the descendants of i that are also ancestors of j (mediators), as it would block causal paths
- DO NOT INCLUDE the descendants of i that are also descendants of j, as it would create collider bias

### Backdoor criterion [Pearl 2009]
should satisfy
- Z does not contain any descendant of i **AND**
- Z blocks all backdoor paths from i to j (all paths that start with an arrow into i <- ...j)


> Adjustment criterion is an extension of backdoor that finds all of them
> Backdoor criterion only finds some (not all) valid adjustment sets

### Adjustment Formula (Backdoor)
$P(X_{j}|do(X_{i} = x_{i})) = \sum{P(X_{j}|X_{i},X_{Z}= X_{Z})P(X_{Z}=x_{z})}$
