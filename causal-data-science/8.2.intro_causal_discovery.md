## Construct a Minimal I-Map
1. Choose any ordering of the variables (X1,...,Xp)
2. Write the factorisation via chain rule, simplify factorization as much as possible with conditional independences
   - $X_i \perp \!\!\! \perp X_j | X_z \Rightarrow P(X_i|X_j, X_z) = P(X_i|X_z)$ 
3. Create a BN in which each X_i is caused by the variables in $P(X_i|X_{pa(i)})$

## Judge whether it is a Minimal I-Map
- A distribution/probability (original factorization) could contain independencies (used to simplify factorization)
- Minimal I-Map is based on given distribution which have some independencies
- if remove an edge creates a new independency/conditional independency that a distribution does not have, then it is not a Minimal I-Map for this distribution


## Perfect Map -> Markov equivalence
### Global Markov Properties and Faithfulness
- d-separation -> conditional independency
- faithful:  d-separation <-> conditional independency


### Existence
- Not every distribution P has a perfect map
- There does not exist a DAG that is a perfect map for P

- Faithfulness violations: independent but not d-separated
  - cancelling paths
  - deterministic relations
- Markov violations:  d-separated but not independent
  - cycles 
  - measurement noise
  - selection bias
