## Graph Representation in Statistical Model
we use a factorization of join probability as a graph
$$
P(x1, x2, x3, x4) = P(x1)P(x2|x1)P(x3|x2,x1)P(x4|x3,x2,x1)
$$


### Assumptions flowchart
- Local Markov Assumption -> Statistical Independencies -> Minimality Assumption -> Statistical Dependencies -> Causal Edges Assumption -> Causal Dependencies


### Local Markov Assumption
Given its parents in the DAG, a node X is independent of all of its non-descendent.
This means given X3 is the parent X4, then X4 are independent of X1 and X2 (non descendants)

$$
P(x4|x3,x2,x1) = P(x4|x3)
$$

### Minimality Assumption
Adjacent nodes in tha DAG are dependent

### Causal Edges Assumption 
In directed graph, every parent is a direct cause of all its children
- it covers the minimality Assumptions 


## Bayesian network factorization
- Local Markov Assumption <=> Bayesian network factorization
$$
P(x1,...,x_{n}) = \prod{P(x_{i}|pa_{i})}
$$
- help simplify the factorisation
- easily read conditional independences
- represent causal models

## Global Markov Properties and Faithfulness
- d-separation -> conditonal independency
- faithful:  d-separation <-> conditional independency
