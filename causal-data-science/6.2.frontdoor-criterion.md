## Frontdoor Criterion
### Intuition
1. Find all mediator variables M on the directed paths between X and Y
2. Estimate the effect of X on **M**
3. Estimate the effect of **M** on Y
4. combine the two effects

### Frontdoor Criterion
Given a CBN(G,p), a set M $\in$ V\\{i,j} satisfies the front door criterion for estimating the causal effect of $X_i$ on $X_j$ with i $\neq$ j:

1. **M** blocks all directed paths from i to j, and 
2. With Z=$\empty$, all backdoor paths from i <-- ... M are blocked, and
   - no open backdoor means no confounding effects, so that we can estimate $P(X_{M}|do(X_{i}) = P(X_{M}|X_{i}))$ without adjustment
