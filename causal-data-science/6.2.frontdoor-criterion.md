## Frontdoor Criterion

### Intuition
1. Find all mediator variables M on the directed paths between X and Y
2. Estimate the effect of X on **M**
3. Estimate the effect of **M** on Y
4. combine the two effects

### Frontdoor Criterion
Given a CBN(G,p), a set M $\subseteq$ V\\{i,j} satisfies the front door criterion for estimating the causal effect of $X_i$ on $X_j$ with i $\neq$ j:

1. **M** blocks all directed paths from i to j, and 
2. With Z=$\empty$, all backdoor paths from i <-- ... M are blocked, and
   - no open backdoor means no confounding effects, so that we can estimate $P(X_{M}|do(X_{i}) = P(X_{M}|X_{i}))$ without adjustment
3. Z={i} blocks all backdoor paths from M <- ... to j


### Causal Effects
$$
\begin{aligned}
&P(X_{j} = x_{j}|do(X_{i} = x_{i})) \\
= &P(X_{M} | do(X_{i})) *P(X_{j}|do(X_{M})) \\
= &P(X_{M}=x_{M}| X_{i} = x_{i})*\sum{P(X_{j}|X_{M}, X_{Z}=X_{z})P(X_{Z}=x_{Z})}
\end{aligned}
