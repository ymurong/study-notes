## Recap: formal definition of causality
1. X has a causal effect on Y iff:
- $\exist{x,x\prime}: P(Y|do(X=x)) \neq P(Y|do(X=x\prime))$
- $\exist{x}: P(Y|do(X=x)) \neq P(Y)$

2. X does not causes Y iff:
- $\forall{x}: P(Y|do(X=x)) = P(Y)$

3. The effect of X on Y is confounded by some confounder (Age) if 
- $P(Y|do(X=x)) \neq P(Y|X=x)$
- Simpson's paradox Exercise<- Age -> Cholesterol

## Adjustment sets
Given a causal Bayesian network (G,p) with DAG G=(V,E)
- we call (valid) adjustment sets for the (total) causal effect of $X_i$ on $X_j$ with i $\neq$ j, the sets Z $\in$ V such that:
-  adjustment sets allows us to estimate post interventional distribution from a combination of observational ones
  
## Identification strategies for causal effects
- Backdoor criterion, Adjustment criterion
- Frontdoor criterion
- Instrumental variables 


## Backdoor criterion, Adjustment Formula
$P(X_{j}|do(X_{i} = x_{i})) = \sum{P(X_{j}|X_{i},X_{Z}= X_{Z})P(X_{Z}=x_{z})}$

- The parents of the treatment are a valid adjustment set

### Additional assumption for adjustment: Positivity
Values in interventional regime should be also possible in the observational regime
- $P(X_{i}, X_{Z}) \gt 0$ for $x_{i} \in X_{i}, x_{Z} \in X_{Z}$
- If all women are treated and men are untreated, we cannot adjust for gender
- adjusting for all possible covariates doesn't always help

### Special case: no causal parents for treatment
if treatment X_{i} has no causal parents (no confounder), then the interventional distribution is the same as the observational distribution conditioned on $X_{i} = x_{i}$

- $P(X_{v}| do(X_{i} = x_{i})) = P(X_{v/i}| X_{i} = x_{i})$

### Special case: using the parents of treatment
- $P(X_{v}| do(X_{i} = x_{i})) = P(X_{v/i, pa(i)}| X_{i} = x_{i}, X_{pa(i)})P(X_{pa(i)})$

## Identifiability
We say an interventional distribution $p(X_{i}|do(X_{j}=x_{j}))$ is identifiable, if we can rewrite it using observational distributions

- For example, if a valid adjustment set exists (backdoor criterion) (do we observe all parents?)
- But also, front door criterion, instrumental variables

## Backdoor criterion 
### Intuition 
- Directed path from i to j are causal (both directly and indirectly) -> DO NOT BLOCK CAUSAL PATH
- Backdoor paths (all paths that start with an arrow into i <-- ...j) induce spurious associations (confoundering effects) -> SHOULD BLOCK Backdoor path
- if we block the spurious assocations, we only get the causal effect
- DO NOT INCLUDE the descendants of i that are also ancestors of j (mediators), as it would block causal paths
- DO NOT INCLUDE the descendants of i that are also descendants of j, as it would create collider bias

### Backdoor criterion [Pearl 2009]
should satisfy
- Z does not contain any descendant of i **AND**
- Z blocks all backdoor paths from i to j (all paths that start with an arrow into i <- ...j)


> Adjustment criterion is an extension of backdoor that finds all of them
> Backdoor criterion only finds some (not all) valid adjustment sets
