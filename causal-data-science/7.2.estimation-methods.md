# Table of Contents

## Estimands for binary treatments
### Average Treatment Effects (ATE)
ATE = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0)] = E[Y|do(T=1)] - E[Y|do(T=0)]

### Average Treatment Effects on the Treated 
ATT = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0) | T=1]

### Average Treatment Effects on the Controlled 
ATC = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0) | T=0]

## Estimation Methods
### Matching 
#### Covariate Balancing 
$T \perp \!\!\! \perp Z \equiv P(Z| T=0) = P(Z|T=1)$

#### Exact Matching 
##### Simplified (only one match)
- single match
- Intuition: find the most similar couple of units in terms of covariates X such that one is in the treatment and the other in the control group
$$
ATT = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0) | T=1] \\
\frac{1}{n_t}\sum_{i=1}^{n_t}(Y_i - Y_{mj(i)})
$$

##### Slightly less simplified (multiple matches)
- multiple matches M (e.g. M =2, M can be random)
- Intuition: taking the average of multiple matched observations from treated to controlled
$$
ATT = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0) | T=1] \\
\frac{1}{n_t}\sum_{i=1}^{n_t}(Y_i - \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M}Y_{mj(i)})
$$

##### Slightly less simplified (multiple matches - bidirectional)
- multiple matches M (e.g. M =2, M can be random)
- Intuition: bi-directional -> taking the average of multiple matched observations from treated to controlled and controlled to treated

$$
ATE = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0)] \\
\frac{1}{n_t + n_c}[\sum_{i=1}^{n_t}(Y_i - \frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M}Y_{mj(i)}) + \sum_{j=1}^{n_c}(\frac{1}{M}\sum_{m=1}^{M}Y_{mi(j)} - Y_{j}))]
$$


> pick one from treatment group and one from control group so that they have the same X. continue to do it until on group run out of units of the same value

#### Distance Matching 
- when exact matching is not possible (continuous variables)
- Using distance: Mahalanobis Distance -> KNN
- Need to check covariate balancing after matching (e.g. std, mean difference)
  - $T \perp \!\!\! \perp X \equiv P(X| T=0) = P(X|T=1)$
- if X is high-dimensional then it's difficult to find good matches -> can we find a single number to match ??? -> Propensity Score 


### Propensity score
#### Propensity score matching (PSM)
- Assumption: binary treatment T, X is valid adjustment set
- Propensity Score: the probability of getting assigned the treatment -> compute $P(T=1|X)$ for each value of $X$
  - $\pi$ := P(T=1 | X=x)
- only one score to match

#### Inverse probability weighting
- For treated T=1: weight by the inverse of  
  - $π= P(T = 1|X=x_i)$
- For untreated T=0: weight by the inverse of  
  - $1 - π= P(T = 0|X=x_i)$
- we can estimate the average causal effect
  - ATE = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0)] = E[Y|do(T=1)] - E[Y|do(T=0)]
$$
P(Y=y|do(T=t)) = \sum_{x}P(Y=y|X=x, T=t)P(X=x) \\
\begin{aligned}
E(Y=y|do(T=t)) &= \sum_{y}y\sum_{x}P(Y=y|X=x, T=t)P(X=x) \\
&= \sum_{y}y\sum_{x}P(Y=y|X=x, T=t)P(X=x)\frac{P(T=t|X=x)}{P(T=t|X=x)} \\
&= \sum_{y}\sum_{x}\frac{y * P(Y=y, X=x, T=t)}{P(T=t|X=x)}
\end{aligned}
$$
Binary Example:
$$
E(Y(t=1)) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}*1\{{T=1}\}*\frac{1}{P(T=1|X_{i})} \\
E(Y(t=0)) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}*1\{{T=0}\}*\frac{1}{P(T=0|X_{i})} \\
$$

- Propensity score needs to be estimated by logistic regression

## Other Estimands
### S-learners
we learn a single model to predict the both potential outcomes ITE: $Y_i(0), Y_i(1)$
- Intuition: sometimes probability can be really hard to calculate in order to estimate $E[Y(t=1|X)]$, in this case, we train a model to predict the $\mu$. Using average ITE to estimate ATE.
- Very useful for customer segmentation

#### biased ATE (separate each X)
- Assumption: X is the valid adjustment set
- $ATE = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0)] = E_X[E[Y(t=1)|X] - E[Y(t=0)|X]]$
- $A\hat{T}E = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mu(1,X_i) - \mu(0,X_i)$


#### biased CATE (separate each X)
- Assumption: $X\cup{W}$ is the valid adjustment set
- $CATE(w) = E[Y(t=1) - Y(t=0)|W=w] = E_X[E[Y(t=1)|X, W=w] - E[Y(t=0)|X, W=w]]$
- $CA\hat{T}E = \frac{1}{n_w}\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1(W=w)[\mu(1,X_i) - \mu(0,X_i)]$
- Issue: for high-dimensional X, S-learners can ignore the treatment (biased)

### X-learners
- Learn two separate models $\mu_1(x_i)$(only treated) and $\mu_0(x_i)$(only controlled)
- we impute the treatment effect per unit (ITE)
- Treatment group: $\hat{\tau}_{i,1} = Y_i - \hat{\mu}_0(X_i)$
- Control group: $\hat{\tau}_{i,0} =  \hat{\mu}_1(X_i) - Y_{i}$


### Augmented Inverse Probability weighting (AIPW)
