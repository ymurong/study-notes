## D-Separation
### Definition
D-separation is a graphical criterion that (under
standard conditions) allows us to read conditional independences:

- Are X and Y conditionally independent

### How it works
1. check all the (undirected) paths from X to Y
2. if **NO ACTIVE PATH**, then X and Y GUARANTEED conditional independence (**ONLY ONE active path would mean NOT GUARANTEE conditional independent**)
3. A path is active if **EVERY** triple is active (only one inactive triple would make whole path inactive)

### About Triples
#### Causal Chain
- Form: A -> B -> C
- Active if middle node is unobserved
- Inactive if middle node is observed

#### Common Cause
- Form: A <- B -> C
- Active if middle node is unobserved
- Inactive if middle node is observed

#### Common Effect
- Form: A -> B <- C
- Active if middle node is observed
- Inactive if middle node is unobserved
- 跟之前正好相反


### Tricks
- finding one active path -> stop -> NOT GUARANTEE conditional independent
- finding one inactive path does not mean we are done !
- GUARANTEE conditional independent only when all path are inactive
- finding one inactive triple -> stop -> inactive path
