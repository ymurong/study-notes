## Complete Partially Directed Acyclic Graph (CPDAG)
- We have a directed edge  if all DAGs in the MEC have  i -> j 
- We have an undirected edge i - j if some DAGs in the MEC have i->j and others have j->i


## How to create CPDAG
### we know the true graph
1. if the true graph is known we can compute the CPDAG representing the MEC

### we don't know the true graph
we perform conditional independence tests on observational data 
and use them to constrain the possible graphs using d-separation

#### SGS, PC
We can estimate a CPDAG from samples of P in three steps: 
1. Determine the skeleton 
2. Determine the v-structures 
3. Direct as many remaining edges as possible 
   1. make sure new direct cannot create cycles or new v-structures
> the directed parts of the CPDAG will agree with , but some parts might stay undirected
