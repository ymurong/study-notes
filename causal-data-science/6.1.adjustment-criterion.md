## Adjustment Criterion
Given a CBN(G,p), a set Z $\subseteq$ V\\{i,j} satisfies the adjustment criterion for estimating the causal effect of $X_i$ on $X_j$ with i $\neq$ j:

1. Z does not contain any descendant of nodes $r \neq i$ on a directed path from i to j (去除i本身)
    - Tips: 
      - find directed path between i and j
      - 除i以外所有点以及他们的子集都不能在Z以内(包括j)
    - Backdoor (Desc(i) $\cap$ = $\empty$)
    - 多一个directed path的限制
2. Z blocks all paths from i to j that are not directed paths from i to j
    - Backdoor (all backdoor paths) 
    - 区别在于不仅要考虑backdoor还要考虑其他outgoing undirected path (extra path to consider)


The adjustment criteria finds all valid adjustment sets (but there are other sets that allow identification of total causal effects - e.g. front door criterion)
