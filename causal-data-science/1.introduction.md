# Content of Table
## What is causality
- A variable X causes another variable Y, if changing (the distribution of) X, e.g. by fixing its value,changes (the distribution of) Y
- you could also have indirect causality and direct causality
- Challenge: estimate the causal effect of an intervention, when we do not have (all possible) interventional data (e.g. observational data)
- Representation: We can represent causal relations in causal graphs: nodes are random variables, edges causal relations


## Causal hierarchy
- intervention: what if I do X? 
- counterfactuals: What if I acted differently


## Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)
- when we don't have RCT, we use observational data
- could lead falsy results if the subjects are not randomly splits in terms of treatment group and control group


## Confounder
- a common cause of the treatment and outcome
- we need to control the confounder
- we should not control everything (food intake example ??? indirect influence)
  

## Selection bias
- unfair selection rule could lead to spurious correlation


## Reichenbach’s principle of common cause
- X causes Y, or
- Y causes X, or
- There exists a common cause between X and Y (or any combination)
- (we ignore selection bias)

## Cycles 
- If X causes Y and Y causes X (even indirectly), X and Y are in a cycle.
- introduce spurious relations

## Simpson’s paradox
It is phenomenon in probability and statistics in which a trend appears in several groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. 

## Causal discovery 
- used to build causal graph



### D-separation criterion
D-separation is a graphical criterion that (under
standard conditions) allows us to read conditional independences

- [Conditional Probability](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/chapter1/1_4_4_conditional_independence.php)
  - $A \perp\!\!\!\perp B$
  - $P(A \cap B | C) = P(A | C) \cdot P(B | C)$
