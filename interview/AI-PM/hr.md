# Tell me about yourself

Currently I am on gap year, doing my master on data science in UVA. I will be finishing all the courses at the end of March and be able to start working at April. Besides, I already have a master in information system in france and a business licence au Gestion from a top business school in China.

Before the gap year, I am a Tech Lead in Renault in charge of an IT marketplace application that allows developers of the whole company to manage web services. As it is a technical application, I am also serving as product owner of this application, collecting requirements for governance team, managing the roadmap and backlog, define the release, coordinating with cross-function teams, organizing the agile ceromonies, coaching young developers, constantly looking for innovations and new ideas, etc

In terms of personalities:
I will describe myself as a highly accountable and results-driven individual who is committed to continuous learning and growth. I am proactive and motivated in searching for solutions when facing problems and challenges. I am empathetic and good at thinking in others' shoes. 


# Biggest strength
My unique background and product mindset. I can define and execute a strategy at a high level while also understanding the execution difficulties at an engineering level. As a product manager, it is really important to see the big picture of the actual values that you brought to the users but at the same time being realistic and pragmatic given the current tech/cost constraints. Optimization is the key. 

## Example: 
Context: Pr√©sales Google avec la nouvelle plateforme API CAAS.

Conflict:
- Business teams, Bigboss, My direct boss all very interested
- Me: I am open to the idea but I still have concerns as I know the details of our existing applications and it is not that simple

Solution: I did an analysis on cost, risks, feasibility. In order to convince them, I try to find the common interests as each stakeholder has their own priorities, je montre que aller cette solution tres rapidement peut avoir les consequences negative plus important que les benefices. Eventually I succced to turn the conflict into alignment.

Biensur, je propose aussi un PLAN B recompenser les choses.


# Greatest weakness
- J'ai bien planifier/faire les choses en avance, mais des fois c peux donner la pression aux parti prenants.



# why should we hire you
1. Proofing record in leading a industry level IT product at both strategic and executional level. Sitting at the intersection of UX, TECH, BUSINESS, I know how to collaborate and compromise between these cross-functional teams.
2. I have a foundational knowledge in DE/DS/AI domain thanks to my educational and industrial experience. 
    - better understand/manage the uncertainties that a Data/AI product has, 
    - better understand the needs of a data/ai product and ensure the team has the enough and right data to deliver results - better communicate/coach AI with stakeholders across the company
3. I have a entrepreneur spirit and assume the responsibility of ensuring the success of given product
4. I am a analytics oriented person and make decisions based on proofs, either from data or from other cross function teams
    - able to explore, prioritize, and action on ideas
5. I have broad interests in life and can be a very good team member to add some sugar and butter in the diversity of the team.

# Why decathlon
1. Decathlon is my favorite sports store, loyal customer myself. You have good quality products of all levels. The store is full of innovations with close tech integration, people who work in shops are always energetic. I always enjoy talking to sales who work in stores
2. I like the vision: bring the sports to the many and company culture: not only the tech4good idea, but also their efforts in being a socially responsible company
(Optional) 
3. But I also see improvement and would like to improve it.....and many possible AI innovations that can bring to it to improve. NLP in customer experience (waiting for explanations are tiresome). CV in customer experience, demand forecasting, inventory management, and more.


# Adyen ML Project
## Show leadership
How I influence the team to achieve the objective. In adyen project, in the beginning I dont know anyone. And for me, if you wanna influence others you need to understand and know them very well, what they like most and dislike most. Then you help them to achieve the goal they wanted. Implicitly, you then starts leading the team, your team members would come for your advice and in exchange you keep them motivated, which in turn, keep the whole team running in high efficiency. So that is exactly what I did
- russian guy who are really good at math and experiments but bad in team work with high pride
- greek guy, really nice going, emotionally intelligent, but need clear objective about what to do otherwise feel lost and become inefficient
- spanish guy, have a lot of innovative ideas, accountable and have enough skills to implement, once given trust and orientation, he can be really a big contributor
- dutch guy, weaker tech background (from another master) but good at writing stuff, good at communicating ideas once given orientation (good for presentations with stakeholders)
- Me, less math, but have both business and tech background (more exprienced than them), so I implictly lead the three presentations, the planning, coaching, collaroting, contributing.
