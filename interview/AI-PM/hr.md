# Tell me about yourself

Currently I am on gap year, doing my master on data science in UVA. I will be finishing all the courses at the end of March and be able to start working at April. Besides, I already have a master in information system in france and a business Baccalauréat au Gestion from a top business school in China.

Before the gap year, I am a Tech Lead in Renault in charge of an IT marketplace application that allows developers of the whole company to manage web services. As it is a technical application, I am also serving as product owner of this application, collecting requirements for governance team, managing the roadmap and backlog, define the release, coordinating with cross-function teams, organizing the agile ceromonies, coaching young developers, constantly looking for innovations and new ideas, etc

In terms of personalities:
I will describe myself as a highly accountable and results-driven individual who is committed to continuous learning and growth. I am proactive and motivated in searching for solutions when facing problems and challenges. I am empathetic and good at thinking in others' shoes. I also like coaching and sharing knowledge.


# Biggest strength
My unique background and mindset. I can create and execute a strategy at a high level while also understanding the execution difficulties at an engineering level. As a product manager, it is really important to see the big picture of the actual values that you brought to the users but at the same time being realistic and pragmatic given the current tech/cost constraints. Optimization is the key. 

Example: Google presales with the new CAAS API platform. (I need to convince the decision makers that the new platform is not mature enough to replace current platform. Relatively new with tech limits, the migration/custom dev costs are high, existing application unmatch with CAAS model, most importantly, little value for users with larger risk of production issues) but on the same time, I need also to think of long terms plans since if one day google said they completely stop supporting IAAS mode, then there would be larger risk. Google does not have smooth migration for their customers which is incredibly unprofessional ... even for google.... never over trust cloud providers and think far...

# Greatest weakness
- I am really analytical, but under very ambiguous or uncertain situations (no exact proof), I may have trouble of confidence in making decisions. In this case, I usually try discuss with different teams to seek for different perspectives

# why should we hire you
1. I have cultivated many hard skills in software engineering domain. 
2. I have a mixed background.
3. I have a foundational knowledge in AI/DS domain and know people both from academia and industry in this domain
4. I have strong learning ability and ready to accept challenges to continuously improve my hard/soft skills. 
5. I have broad interests in life and can be a very good team member to add some sugar and butter in the diversity of the team.

# Why decathlon
1. Decathlon is my favourite brand sports brand.
2. I really like the point of sales done by Decathlon (smooth shopping experience with a lot of innovations). But I also see problems, and many possible AI innovations that can bring to it to improve. NLP in customer experience (waiting for explanations are tiresome). CV in customer experience, demand forecasting, inventory management, and more.


# Adyen ML Project
## Show leadership
How I influence the team to achieve the objective. In adyen project, in the beginning I dont know anyone. And for me, if you wanna influence others you need to understand and know them very well, what they like most and dislike most. Then you help them to achieve the goal they wanted. Implicitly, you then starts leading the team, your team members would come for your advice and in exchange you keep them motivated, which in turn, keep the whole team running in high efficiency. So that is exactly what I did
- russian guy who are really good at math and experiments but bad in team work with high pride
- greek guy, really nice going, emotionally intelligent, but need clear objective about what to do otherwise feel lost and become inefficient
- spanish guy, have a lot of innovative ideas, accountable and have enough skills to implement, once given trust and orientation, he can be really a big contributor
- dutch guy, weaker tech background (from another master) but good at writing stuff, good at communicating ideas once given orientation (good for presentations with stakeholders)
- Me, less math, but have both business and tech background (more exprienced than them), so I implictly lead the three presentations, the planning, coaching, collaroting, contributing.
