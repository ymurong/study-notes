## Describe the characteristics of the recent shift in data analysis

1. storage cost per gigabyte drop in a logarithms scale
2. past measurement -> prediction
3. data generation explosion -> from well-defined data (transactions) -> less structured data (web)
4. IT monopoly access to data -> everyone access to data cloud
5. 4V: volume, velocity, variety, veracity(qualtity varies)



## Explain different forms of parallelism and scalability 

### Parallelism
#### Task Parallelism
   - multi-tasking
   - execute many independent tasks at once
   - operating system executing different processes at once on a multi-core machine


#### Data Parallelism 
slice the data (the same task) and handle in parallel (Map Reduce)


#### Pipeline Parallelism
???

### Scalability 
ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work by adding resources to a system

- scale up/out
- linear scalability with number of machines cores in scale-out settings 
- elastic scaling 


## Distinguish between scalability and performance

### Pitfalls
- scalability often comes with increased overheads (network communication, coordination overhead)
- system A could be way more scalable than system B (more cores -> speed up) but system B could be always faster then A and B stops scaling as it reaches a bottleneck of execution time
